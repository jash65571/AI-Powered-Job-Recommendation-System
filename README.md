Project Overview
This is a personalized job recommendation platform that uses Machine Learning (ML) to analyze job seekers’ skills, experience, and preferences, matching them with the most relevant job listings. It mimics the functionality of LinkedIn's job suggestion engine but provides customized recommendations based on real-time job market trends.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (Next.js for SSR), Tailwind CSS, Redux (for state management)
Backend: Node.js (Express.js), Python (for AI/ML processing)
Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data), Elasticsearch (for fast search indexing)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, OpenAI API (for NLP-based resume parsing)
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 (Google, LinkedIn), JWT
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (S3 for file storage, Lambda for ML model execution), Docker, Kubernetes
Third-party APIs: LinkedIn API (for fetching user job experience), Glassdoor API (for salary insights)
How It Works
1. User Registration & Profile Setup
A user signs up using OAuth-based authentication (Google/LinkedIn) or manually creates an account.
They input work experience, skills, education, preferred job titles, and location.
The system parses their resume using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to extract relevant keywords.
All details are stored in PostgreSQL, and their searchable profile index is saved in Elasticsearch.
2. Job Posting & Aggregation
Employers can post jobs with descriptions, required skills, location, and salary.
The system also scrapes job postings from third-party APIs (e.g., LinkedIn, Glassdoor).
Jobs are stored in PostgreSQL and indexed in Elasticsearch for fast retrieval.
3. AI-Based Job Matching
When a job seeker logs in, the system compares their profile with job listings using AI models.
ML models analyze:
Keyword Matching (Resume ↔ Job Description)
Similarity Score Calculation (Cosine Similarity Algorithm)
Market Demand vs. Applicant Skills (Predictive Analysis)
Top job matches are recommended with a percentage match score.
Users can bookmark, apply, or dismiss jobs.
4. Application Tracking
Users can apply directly through the platform (if job posting allows).
Employers get notifications when an application is submitted.
Users can track application status (e.g., pending, shortlisted, rejected).
